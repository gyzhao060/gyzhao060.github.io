About me
---

I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Severo Ochoa Center of Excellence in the Institute of Astrophysics of Andalusia (IAA-CSIC). I am also a member and a working group coordinator of the  EventHorizon Telescope Collaboration (EHTC). My research topic is studying supermassive blackholes  (SMBHs)  and  Active  Galactic  Nuclei  (AGNs)  with  very  long  baseline  interferometry(VLBI), which provides the highest resolution in astronomy as it forms a network of radiotelescopes. VLBI is ideal for studying compact objects like SMBHs, and astrophysical jetslaunched from the vicinity of black holes.
